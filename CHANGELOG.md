# Changelog

Xelqun Panels is pre-alpha. Until 1.0, a minor version can break existing code, and each break is listed here.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **A new panel works straight away.** `make:xelqun-panel` left out `login()` and any pages, so `/admin` was a 404.
- **A missing `PanelUser` says so at login, in debug mode.** With the right password, the login page only said the credentials were wrong.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-06

The first release. It needs `xelqun/forms` 0.6 and `xelqun/tables` 0.4.

### Added

- **Panels.** Declare one or more in a `PanelProvider`, each with its own path, guard, brand and color, in light and dark themes.
- **Authentication.** Login, logout, password reset, registration, email verification and a profile page, per panel, with no Fortify. Access is denied unless a user model implements `PanelUser`.
- **Resources.** One class gives a model list, create, edit and view pages, with table actions and policies on every step. No policy means no access.
- **Pages.** Custom pages with header actions, or your own Vue component inside the panel's layout.
- **Dashboards.** `StatsOverview`, `ListWidget`, `TileWidget`, `TableWidget` and your own widgets, loaded after the page paints.
- **The shell.** A sidebar with groups, badges and a footer card, a top bar with breadcrumbs, ⌘K page search, a user menu, a theme switcher, a collapsible sidebar and a drawer on phones.
- **Commands.** `xelqun-panels:install`, `make:xelqun-panel`, `make:xelqun-page` and `make:xelqun-resource`.
